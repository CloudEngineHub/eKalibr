    <a><strong>Version 1.0.0 » eKalibr: Event-Based Visual Calibration Framework</strong></a>
</p>

`eKalibr` is a visual calibration framework for event cameras, inspired by the well-known frame-based calibration framework `Kalibr`. `eKalibr` has the following features:

+ Calibration using a circular grid pattern. `eKalibr` includes a precise circular grid pattern recognition pipeline, capable of directly extracting patterns from raw event streams.
+ It is open-source and free of charge. Any organization, as long as it complies with the `eKalibr` open-source license, can freely use `eKalibr` for secondary development without restrictions.
+ Currently, `eKalibr` supports intrinsic calibration of event cameras. In the future, I will extend `eKalibr` to support multi-event-camera and event-IMU (event-inertial) spatiotemporal calibration. Stay tuned!
